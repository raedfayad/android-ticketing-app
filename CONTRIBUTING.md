# Local Development
To enable local development with a local Flask backend, you can use the following steps:
1. Search through the codebase, and replace all occurrences of `https://10.0.2.11` with `http://10.0.2.2:5000` (assuming that your Flask backend is running on port localhost:5000)
2. When you're ready to merge, revert the changes made in step 1
